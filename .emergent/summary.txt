The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex set of requirements, evolving the TEIA application from an initial concept to a functional web platform. Key accomplishments include implementing global footers with dynamic rendering, enhancing button aesthetics with a custom CSS class, integrating a backend-driven partners carousel, and deploying a mathematical reCAPTCHA for contact forms. The engineer successfully refactored the language selector into the header for a more discreet user experience, adaptable across desktop and mobile. A significant feature, an interactive OpenStreetMap (Leaflet) for establishment listings, was integrated, optimized for UX and accessibility with adjustable height and scroll-to-element functionality. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated resilience in debugging persistent frontend compilation errors (JSX, TypeScript, SSR issues) and environment conflicts (port clashes), often leveraging the  to diagnose and resolve complex problems, ensuring the application remained operational despite several critical build failures. The current work involves refining the layout of establishment listings.

The TEIA - Algarve Autism Friendly application aims to be an inclusive tourism platform for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and neuromotor needs in Algarve, Portugal. Initially a mobile concept, it pivoted to a web-first (Next.js) approach for both the main application and an admin panel, deferring external integrations like Google Maps, Stripe, and push notifications, and removing reservation/payment functionalities. The app must support Portuguese and English.

Key implemented features include:
*   **Homepage:** Informative with illustrative photos, partners carousel, and dynamic footer.
*   **Navigation:** Clear menu (Inicio, Sobre NÃ³s, Nossa Teia, Contacto) and a prominent Login/Logout button, with a subtle language selector in the header.
*   **Establishment Listings (Nossa Teia):** A directory featuring an interactive map (OpenStreetMap) with clickable pins that scroll to detailed establishment cards. Each card provides photos, sensory information, accessibility, contact, and special hours. Users can view individual establishment detail pages.
*   **User Authentication:** Role-based access for Super Admins and regular Users. Super Admins manage establishments (CRUD), users, and certification processes, utilizing an intuitive address input system with simulated geocoding. Users can comment and rate locations based on specific criteria.
*   **Contact Form:** Includes a mathematical reCAPTCHA for spam prevention.
*   **Accessibility & Design:** High contrast interface, simplified navigation, adjustable typography, responsive design, and base64 image handling.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit request to improve the layout of the establishment listings on the Nossa Teia page. Previously, the establishment information was displayed in a single column, which the user felt was too wide and not optimally aligned.

The current work focuses on:
1.  **Changing the layout from 1 column to 3 columns in a grid structure.** This involves modifying the container and styling for the establishment cards in  to utilize a grid layout for better visual density and presentation.
2.  **Adjusting the width and alignment of the establishment section.** The user requested that this section should be in line with the logo and the logout button, implying it should occupy the full content width, matching the general header alignment rather than a contained box width, while still maintaining inner padding.

The engineer has already started by:
*   Removing the  padding from the search section in  (Chat Message 713-714) to prepare it for a wider alignment.
*   Attempting to adjust the establishment section to use full width () and a 3-column grid layout (Chat Message 715-716).

The last action was an attempt to change the CSS classes related to the layout for the establishment cards. The work is in progress, specifically altering the display from a vertical stack () to a responsive grid.

<optional_next_step>
Continue modifying  to implement a 3-column grid for establishments with full-width alignment, as requested.
